### ROAD Map

- Challenging to add mobile controls
- Rotate screen detection
- Fix few levels which drive me mad since 1992 =)

### OTHER Version

There is a newer version of the original author (remaker) yet we stick to this one as it contains less gear, less menus, but only a game's originals levels. However the new vrsion you find here, it's cool: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall">Lode Runner - Total Recall (超級運動員 - 全面回憶)</a>
