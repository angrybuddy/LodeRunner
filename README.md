### ROAD Map

- Challenging to add mobile controls
- Rotate screen detection
- Fix few levels, impossible or boring or both, which drive me mad since 1992 (ongoing)

### FIXES APPLIED

- collectable gold is now a bitcoin pixelwork
- running guy wears rasta colours
- other changes in colors and decor (ongoing)

### OTHER Version

There is a newer version of the original author (or remaker) yet we stick to this one as it contains less gear, less menus, but only a game's originals levels. However that newer version you find by the following url: <a href="https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall">Lode Runner - Total Recall (超級運動員 - 全面回憶)</a>
